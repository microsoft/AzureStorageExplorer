# Bug Reports and Feature Requests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Storage Explorer welcomes feedback! However, we can't guarantee that we'll respond to your submissions right away. If you need assistance, _do not_ submit a bug report here! Please submit an [Azure support request].

Before submitting a bug report or feature request, please follow these guidelines:

* Make sure you're running the [latest version of Storage Explorer](https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureStorageExplorer/releases/latest).

* Check existing resources, such as the [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-explorer-troubleshooting) or the [release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureStorageExplorer/releases). You'll find solutions to common problems or issues we are aware of.

* Search the list of [open issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureStorageExplorer/issues). It's very likely someone else may have already submitted your issue.

* Fill out the appropriate [issue template](https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureStorageExplorer/issues/new/choose) as completely as you can. Complete and concise reports will help make your issue much easier and faster to resolve.
